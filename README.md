# BloodBond
## Solution Challenge 2024

### Problem Statement
When in an urgent need of blood our first instinct is to contact family and friends, next is to look for Blood banks and last is to pray. There are 3 major problems, first: our contacts are limited and Blood banks are already in shortfall of Blood, second: we are facing the lowest number of blood donations in the last 20 years of history, third and most important the shortage of fresh blood.
15 Indian states lack registered blood banks in at least 2 districts, with Arunachal Pradesh topping the list at 14. This is terrifying.
